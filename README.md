- 👋 Hi, I’m @lectri
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, and getting better at engineering in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning using the pyglet module in Python to pratice making simple games, I'm working on Snake, and plan to work on minesweeper and tetris.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NOTHING. I am a lone wolf for now...
